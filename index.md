Hi I am Akash singh. I love to explore new advancements in computer systems while sipping my Coffee. I am an explorer by nature and love to be outdoors when i am not on my desk. I will try to maintain this site through my learning journey in tech and life. Writing around my travels, adventures and whatever I learn in short and long form.
